    <h2>PhD Research</h2><p>My PhD research involves detecting and prosecuting financial crime involving cryptocurrencies. My project will adapt data science-based fraudulent transaction detection methods used in traditional financial services to the cryptocurrency market and demonstrate how they can be used to effectively prosecute financial crimes involving cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>The results of this project will provide a roadmap for prosecution of these offences, as well as an empirical basis for policymakers to develop evidence-based legislation surrounding digital currencies worldwide. It will also enable innovation, facilitating the entry of conventional financial services companies into the cryptocurrency arena by providing a method for conducting due diligence on these transactions in the absence of accepted anti-money laundering processes.</p>

<p>I recently completed a study on explaining prosecution outcomes in cryptocurrency-based financial crime cases in U.S. federal courts.</p>

<h2>Consent Token</h2>

<p>I currently serve as Crypto Advisor for Consent Token, a product which radically improves the efficiency of digital background verification. The Consent Token is a new token built on the Ethereum blockchain that can be exchanged between organisations issuing claims, users who hold the claims, and organisations that verify claims.</p>

<p>

The token can be used to obtain a variety of consent-based services on the Consent platform. The utility of the token is based on user’s consent to store, share and transfer verified credentials. For more information see <a href=“https://www.consenttoken.com/>here.</a></p>
